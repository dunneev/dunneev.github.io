Hi, my name is Evan. 

I'm a software developer located in Grand Rapids, Michigan. My interests range from usability, computer graphics, and emulation to racquetball and Super Smash Brothers (Melee).

I'm currently seeking a job, so feel free to check out my REDACTED and send me an e-mail.

I'll be keeping a portfolio of personal projects here.

Thanks for stopping by!
